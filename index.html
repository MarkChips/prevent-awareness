                    <p>Prevent aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. It does this by tackling the
                        ideological causes of terrorism, intervening early to support those susceptible to radicalisation, 
                        and enabling people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage and rehabilitate.</p>

                    <h3>Prevent is better than Cure<i class="fa fa-medkit" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Schools are valuable in providing the educational dimension of the Prevent duty through the 
                        Citizenship lessons on the National Curriculum. Since July 2015, schools also have a legal 
                        responsibility to have "due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism" 
                        under the Prevent duty and Child Protection and Safeguarding guidelines.</p>

                    <p>The role of our Prevent Officers is to help people vulnerable to radicalisation move away from extremism.
                        It can be hard to know what to do if youâ€™re worried someone close is expressing extreme views or hatred, 
                        which could lead to them harming themselves or others. 
                        They are here to listen and offer help and advice.</p>

                    <p>The journey to becoming radicalised is different for everyone and there are many reasons why 
                        someone becomes vulnerable. Radicalisation can take place very quickly, or over a long period of time.</p>
